            Software engineer with a background in architecture and design. I survey the bigger picture to frame the smaller solutions that necessitate creative problem solving, employing a methodical approach toward a deeper understanding of where these proverbial puzzle pieces may fit. This is where my most eloquent solutions are found. To name just a few of my joys in this life, I love exploring different corners of the world, solving the New York Times crossword, and hanging in the company of my dog and my favorite humans.
