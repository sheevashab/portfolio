## Description
This website displays my personal portfolio of projects that I created while completing my full-stack software engineering immersive with General Assembly. It gives a small insight into who I am as a person and what I am capable of as a developer.

## Dependencies
I created this site with React App and its dependency react-router-dom. I also used a few installed icons and components from MUI alongside traditional CSS.
